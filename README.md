Face Detection Worker Service
Introduction
The Face Detection Worker Service is a powerful application built using C# that leverages cutting-edge computer vision algorithms to detect and analyze faces in images and videos. It provides a scalable, efficient, and reliable solution for face detection tasks, allowing you to integrate it seamlessly into your applications.

Features
Accurate Face Detection: The worker service utilizes advanced face detection algorithms to identify and locate faces in images and videos with high precision.
Multiple Face Detection: It can detect multiple faces within a single image or video frame, making it suitable for scenarios with group photos or crowded scenes.
Real-time Face Detection: With its optimized processing capabilities, the service can perform face detection in real-time, enabling applications to handle live video streams or time-sensitive scenarios.
Robust Performance: The worker service is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently and effectively, ensuring reliable face detection even in demanding environments.
Flexible Integration: It provides a well-defined API and supports various input and output formats, allowing easy integration into your existing C# applications or services.
Configurable Parameters: You can customize various parameters such as detection sensitivity, face size thresholds, and more to adapt the service to specific requirements.
Scalability and Parallel Processing: The service is built to scale horizontally, enabling it to process multiple images or videos concurrently, leveraging the full potential of modern hardware.
How It Works
The Face Detection Worker Service follows a straightforward workflow to detect faces:

Input: Provide images or videos to the worker service for face detection. It accepts a wide range of formats, including popular image file types and video streams.
Processing: The worker service employs sophisticated algorithms to analyze the input and identify faces accurately. It utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning models to achieve excellent detection results.
Face Detection Results: The service generates detailed information about each detected face, including coordinates, facial landmarks, and other relevant attributes.
Output: Retrieve the face detection results, which can be used for various purposes such as facial recognition, emotion analysis, age estimation, and more. The service provides output in a structured format that is easy to process and integrate into downstream applications.
